Getting Started
===============

This is a python library that wraps a number of useful OS X frameworks.

Develop
=======
cffi wrappers for various frameworks live in the osx.frameworks modules. Run
the osx._corefoundation_cffi_build module to create the osx._corefoundation.so
module. That contains the cffi extension module for the wrappers. Each time
changes are made to the wrapper modules, re-run the cffi build.

The other modules in osx are Python objects that wrap various CoreFoundation
objects to provide implicit CFRetain/CFRelease behavior and also simple
data conversion APIs between the CF types and Python types. For example to
turn a Python string "s" into a CFStringRef:

	cfstr = CFStringRef.fromString(s)
	
The base Python CFObjectRef class assumes ownership of the underlying CF object
and will always release it. If the CF object being passed in has not already been
retained, then set the "owned" argument to False.

Install
=======

python setup.py build
